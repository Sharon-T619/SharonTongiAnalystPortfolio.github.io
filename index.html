									</a></h2>

									<p>Using Jupyter Notebook, the heart dataset was analyzed and processed before the ML models were built and tested using the training data and test data, respectively. The project relied on various libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy.stats, OS, Seaborn, Time, and Matplotlib. For the purpose of modeling, I deployed six models from Sklearn libraries: RandomForest, KNeighbors, LogisticRegression, SVC, GradientBoosting, and GaussianNB. After conducting the preliminary data analysis (dataset information, checking data types, checking the presence of null values, and finding duplicate values), I went ahead and conducted variable analysis using plots, both histograms and KDE plots, then checking data skewness and finding outliers in the set using combined plots (boxplots and stripplots). Then I ran univariate analysis on the categorical data using barplots, followed by bivariate analysis using KDE plots, heatmaps, and count plots to explore the relationships between two variables. Before building the models, I performed data preprocessing (label encoding, standardization, train_test_split [70% train, 30% test]) because clean data is needed to build an accurate model. Using the 6 model, I was able to train and predict results using a 10-fold CV and confusion matrix. The hyperparameters were optimized using GridSearchCV before the model evaluation was done. A confusion matrix of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score was generated. To finalize the project, model evaluation using the ROC and AUC from roc_curve and sklearn metrics was used, plotting the ROC curve and printing the AUC. From the outputs, RF, KNN, and SVC performed well in predicting heart failure.

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Diwali%20Sales" class="image fit"><img src="images/Sales.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Data analysis was run on sales data to identify sales and patterns as well as generate useful insights from the data. Data preparation involved dropping unnecessary columns and null values, renaming columns, and changing data types. I used both countplots and barplots to visualize the data and answer various questions, such as: Which is the most popular product?, Which is the least profitable product category?, Determined the customer base in terms of states: top- Top performing states in terms of orders made and amount spent, as well as the demographic characteristics of the best customers. </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Wine_Quality" class="image fit"><img src="images/Wine.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> In this project, I analyzed the Red Wine data and tried to understand which variables were responsible for the quality of the wine. Each variable was analyzed individually using both boxplots and histograms to visualize the distribution and ascertain the direction of the outliers. The correlation between the variables was determined on a correlation table to find correlated variables. Bivariate plots between the dependent variable (quality) and the independent variables were run—both boxplots and histograms. A linear model was created to predict the outcome of the test set data.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Stroke_prediction">Stroke Prediction using Random Forest <br />
										in R</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Stroke_prediction" class="image fit"><img src="images/Stroke.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Using libraries such as tidyverse, caret, gridExtra, and randomForest, I was able to analyze the stroke data, train, and test the performance of an Rf model. The project involved changing data types (converting character columns into factors), generating a statistical distribution of the dataset, and dropping a single row from the dataset in the gender column that had 'Other'. From the dataset, approximately 5% of the total entries were missing in the BMI column, so I used the mean values of the column to replace them. After the missing values and data types had been configured properly, graphs for each variable were generated to gain insights into the dataset using ggplots. The relationship between the variables and the target variable [stroke possibility] was then explored. For model building and prediction, the dataset was split into 70% for the train set and 30% for the test set. RandomForest was then used for the data modeling, giving an Out-of-Bag estimate error of 7.13%,  number of trees of = 500 and variables at each split = 3. A confusion matrix was used to see how the classification model performed on the test data. In conclusion, the model was well trained on the training data set.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Salary_Prediction">Salary prediction <br />
											in Jupyter  </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Salary_Prediction" class="image fit"><img src="images/salary.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I was able to do a preliminary analysis of the dataset and deal with the most obvious issues with the data first (nulls, duplicates, and unnecessary columns). The column Job Titles had 191 unique values, which was difficult to analyze, so I had to categorize them into groups of similar job domains. The education level was also represented in two different ways, so I grouped the values into four distinct groups. Followed by EDA, looking to understand the distribution of the data using pie charts, histograms, and countplots. To explore the relations between independent variables and the target variable (salary), I used scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, and bar plots. Data processing was then performed before prediction models (Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor) were built. GridSearchCV was used for the purpose of hypertuning the models; the models were then rebuilt using the best parameters and used to predict the employee salary using the test set. A model evaluation was conducted where actual and predicted values were visualized using a distplot. The metrics used for this project included r2_score, mean_squared_error, and mean_absolute_error from sklearn metrics. I concluded that employee salaries are dependent on years of experience, job title, and education level. The RF regressor performed better than the DT regressor, but not by much.

										<h2><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sharon.tong.i">Data Visualization<br />

									<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sharon.tong.i" class="image fit"><img src="images/Tableau logo.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Tableau was used for the analysis and creation of dashboards for the following projects: Road Accidents, Customer data analysis, HR analytics and Netflix. On Road accident analysis, I was able to produce a dashboard with KPIs on the total accidents, total casualties, fatal casualties, serious casualties, slight casualties, and total casualties by vehicle type. I was also able to explore cases by weather conditions, location, and road types. I also calculated new fields such as year-on-year growth, which involved the current year and past-year columns. For customer data analysis, I worked on descriptive customer analysis tasks such as revenue per state, revenue based on month of the year, revenue based on age, revenue percentage per region, and revenue per category per gender before building the dashboard. HR analytics focused on HR issues such as employee count, attrition count, average age of employees,  gender of the employees, and job rating before building the dynamic dashboard using education filters as well as action filters. Netflix data analysis focused on insights such as total movies and TV shows by year, total movies and shows by country, top 10 genres, distribution of movies and shows, ratings, etc.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Bikes_sales">Bikes Sales Dashbord <br />

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Sharon-T619/PortfolioWebsite/tree/main/Bikes_sales" class="image fit"><img src="images/Excel.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Excel was used to clean, analyze, and create a dashboard for Bike sales. The main objective was to analyze the bike sales count data across different regions (Europe, North America, and the Pacific), marital status, and education levels in the dataset. I performed data cleaning to remove duplicates in the set, unnecessary spaces, spelling mistakes, special characters, and general data formatting. Due to the varying ranges in the age column, I created a custom column called "Age Brackets", I created pivot tables, charts, and graphs for visualization purposes and easy understanding. To finalize the project, I built a dashboard that allows users to interact with the data. The project enhances the understanding of spreadsheet functionalities, data cleaning techniques, and data visualization.
